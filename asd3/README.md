Implement: A regular binary tree (non-searching and non-balancing) with an implementation of depth-first traversal (the traversal direction is not important, recursive traversal is acceptable). An algorithm for parsing bracket notation of the tree. Example: (8 (9 (5)) (1)) — root 8, left child 9, right child 1, left child of node 9 — 5. AVL tree (advanced version — K-d tree) with implementation of insertion, deletion, search, breadth-first traversal, and depth-first traversal (all 3 types using the iterative approach). Demonstrate:

Reading bracket notation (by reading from a file). Step 1 either creates a binary tree or reports an error (incorrect symbols, incorrectly placed brackets, not a binary tree at all, etc.). Traverse the obtained tree and create an AVL (or K-d) tree. Demonstrate the output of all nodes in 4 ways: breadth-first and 3 depth-first traversals.
