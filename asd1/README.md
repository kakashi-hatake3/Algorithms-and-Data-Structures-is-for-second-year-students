Implement the following data structures: doubly linked list, dynamic array, and stack. The stack can be implemented based on either a list or separately. Use the stack to implement the Shunting Yard algorithm. Allowed symbols in the original expression: +, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos, (, ), 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. To simplify tokenizing the input string, it is allowed to separate each symbol with a space.
